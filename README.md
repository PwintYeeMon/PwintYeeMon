* ðŸŽ“ I hold a bachelor's degree from University of Greenwich in Computing, specialising in Information Systems. 
* âœ¨ I gained exposure to the UX world when I took a module in Human Computer Interaction Design and developed an interest in this field ever since.
* ðŸ˜„ Since then, I've been self-studying about HCI and UX and have participated in hackathons as a UX UI Designer, completed Google UX Design courses, attended a mini bootcamp and a summer accelarator.
* ðŸ’» And now, I'm working as a UX Designer!
